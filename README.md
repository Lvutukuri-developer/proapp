# ProApp

ProApp is a social accountability-based productivity app designed to reduce procrastination by leveraging friend circles, deadlines, and gamification.

## Core Idea
Users create or join small accountability circles with friends. When a user misses an assignment deadline, their circle is notified. Completing tasks on time earns points, encouraging consistent productivity.

## MVP User Flow
1. User signs up or logs in  
2. User creates or joins an accountability circle  
3. User adds assignments with due dates  
4. App sends deadline reminders  
5. User completes the assignment or misses the deadline  
6. If missed, the user’s circle is notified  
7. Points and leaderboard update automatically
